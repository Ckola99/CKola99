## About Me

I'm Christopher Kola, a 24-year-old Catholic easy going guy of Congolese descent living in South Africa. I'm also passionate about basketball and love watching anime. In my free time, I enjoy trading, working out, listening to music mainly r&b and hip-hop, and just living life with my friends. I'm an aspiring full-stack software engineer and hard-nose entrepreneur. For the most part, I'm just trying to find my place in the 1's and 0's.
